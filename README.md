# Magazine
The decline in subscriptions from the previous year is being examined by a magazine company
We will be using a logistic regression model and an SVM model to predict magazine subscription behavior. 
All the categorical variables have been encoded. 
The column revenue has a perfect separation when the customer did not accept the offer on the first campaign. 
This column will not be used while building the model.
